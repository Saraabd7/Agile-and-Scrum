## Agile Values:

• Individuals and interactions over processes and tools;

• working software over comprehensive documentation;

• customer collaboration over contract negotiation;

• responding to change over following a plan.

## Agile Principles:

1. Satisfying customers through early and continuous delivery of valuable work.

all the work and the challenges with performing the work.

## Scrum Roles:

who fully understands all the requirements and needs of the Stakeholder. He is also responsible for the successful business strategy of the project.
Generally, he can be defined as the representative of the customer interests in the Scrum team.

- Scrum Master: The ScrumMaster is just a coach who helps to make the work of the Scrum team more effective.

- The Scrum development team members: The development team members are responsible for the project’s performance. There is no personal responsibility in Scrum. The work of the team is estimated as a whole, so
there is no ability to find someone to blame for the failure of the project.

## Scrum Events:
All events are time-boxed. Once a Sprint begins, its duration is fixed and cannot be shortened or lengthened. The remaining events may end whenever the purpose of the event is achieved, ensuring an appropriate amount of time is spent without allowing waste in the process.


### The Scrum Events are:

• Sprint

• Sprint Planning

• Daily Scrum

• Sprint Review

• Sprint Retrospective

## Scrum Artifacts

Scrum Artifacts represent work or value to provide transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation. Artifacts defined by Scrum are specifically designed to maximize transparency of key information so that everybody has the same understanding of the artifact.

### The Scrum Artifacts are:

• Product Backlog

• Sprint Backlog

• Increment
